## Authentication with Better-Auth
whenever new plugin is added to better-auth run this command to generate the table and columns and then manually adjust according to the code styles of this repository. You will find auth related files in `lib` folder

```

## Database Migrations with Drizzle ORM and Neon
Database migrations are managed using Drizzle ORM. To create and run migrations, use the following commands
```shell
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```
if you are working on a feature branch and want to quickly test your schema change without generating a new migration, you can use
```shell
pnpm db:push
```
This will push the current schema state to the database without creating a migration file. Remember to generate a proper migration before merging to main branch.
